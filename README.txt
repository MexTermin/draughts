Draughts is a board game for two opponents. The game consists of moving the pieces diagonally 
through the red or white squares of a board of 64 squares with the intention of 
eating (capturing) the pieces of the opposing player passing over those pieces.

    - Draughts is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard.

	- One player has the green pieces; the other has the yellow pieces.

	- Players alternate turns.

	- A player may not move an opponent's piece.

	- A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. 

    - The pieces can only move one square at a time except when they are eating an enemy piece

	- If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond
    it is vacant, the piece may be eated (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.

	- Only the red squares of the checkered board are used. 

	- Capturing is mandatory
	
	- Normal pieces can only be moved forward (where the opponent's pieces are located at the beginning of the game)

    - Queen pieces can be moved back and forth but the same amount of squares as normal pieces
